#Approach
1. In this test I first thought to match daltix_id if product id is same.While working on data i also realised that Every first word in name is mostly the brand name, it helps me to fill the missing values in Brand Column.

1. Start with crunching the data by matching Daltix id by Prduct Id
2. After observing the data - Every first word in name is mostly the brand name
3. Remove Stop words - Dutch
